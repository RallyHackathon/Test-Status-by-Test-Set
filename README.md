Test-Status-by-Test-Set
================================

This app conveys test status for a given iteration in 3 sections:

- First, a summary, which includes each test set, percentage of tests executed, number passed, number failed, etc.
- Second, a list of the tests which have been run and whether they passed or failed.
- Third, a list of the tests which are remaining to be run.
